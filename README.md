The Brassroots iOS/Android app

## Installation Guide

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for
development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

> This assumes you already have Node, NPM, and the React Native CLI

Ensure the newest version of Node is installed

```zsh
brew install node
```

Ensure the newest version of NPM is installed

```zsh
sudo npm i -g npm
```

Install *Cocoapods* using

```zsh
RubyGems
sudo gem install cocoapods

Homebrew
brew install cocoapods
```

> The reason we use version 1.4.0 is because the newer versions cause some mishaps, but we will
> update as soon as these issues are fixed.

Install *Fastlane* using

```zsh
RubyGems
sudo gem install fastlane -NV

Homebrew
brew cask install fastlane
```

Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

```zsh
xcode-select --install
```

### Getting Started

The first thing we want to do is clone the repo in the desired directory

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/tunerinc/brassroots.git
```

Now that we have the repo cloned with a specific branch selected, let's install all of our npm
packages

```zsh
cd brassroots && npm i
```

> You may encounter an error at this point with the message
>
> ```zsh
> Error: Cannot find module '../lib/utils/unsupported.js'
> ```
> 
> To fix this, run the following commands:
> 
> ```zsh
> sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm
> brew reinstall node
> ```

The next thing we need to do is install `third-party`, then configure `glog` from `react-native`

```zsh
cd node_modules/react-native/ && ./scripts/ios-install-third-party.sh && cd ../../

cd node_modules/react-native/third-party/glog-0.3.5/ && ../../scripts/ios-configure-glog.sh && cd ../../../../
```

> One thing to note is the step above is unnecessary if you will be building in Xcode exclusively.
> If you think you'll run the project ever using the RN cli, then run this before doing so.

In order to get the pod *Interactable* to work properly, we need to create a `.podspec` file for it.
Navigate within the project to `node_modules/react-native-interactable/lib/ios` and create the file `Interactable.podspec` with the following code inside:

```ruby
Pod::Spec.new do |s|
  s.name = "Interactable"
  s.version = "1.0.0"
  s.summary = "Interactable"
  s.description = "Interactable"
  s.homepage = "https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable"
  s.license = "MIT"
  s.author = { "author" => "author@domain.com" }
  s.platform = :ios, "7.0"
  s.source = { :git => "https://github.com/wix/react-native-interactable.git", :tag => "master" }
  s.source_files = "Interactable/**/*.{h,m}"
  s.requires_arc = true
  s.dependency "React"
end
```

Now we are ready to install our pods by running

```zsh
cd ios && pod install
```

> Cocoapods could not find compatible versions for pod "insert PodName"
>
> ```zsh
> pod update [insert PodName] && pod install`
> ```
>
> If the above step doesn't work, you can run the following to delete the pod lock file:
>
> ```zsh
> rm Podfile.lock
> pod install
> ```

With our pods installed, we can now install the certificates we need in order to get the app to run
underneath the team's Apple Developer account. For this, we are using fastlane to automatically
manage these

```zsh
fastlane match appstore
fastlane match development
```

> The first prompt will be the URL `https://github.com/therealaldo/brassroots-profiles` to the git
> repo containing all of the certificates.
>
> The next prompts will be for the email and password for the Apple Developer account tied to the
> app if you haven't entered the information before. Reach out to attain these as you will be
> prompted for a 6-digit code because of two-factor authentication.

At this point, you're going to want to open the `.xcworkspace` in Xcode.

When Xcode finally opens, we want to make sure we are using the correct path for *DerivedData*.
Navigate to *File->Workspace Settings*, clicking on *Advanced*, and then selecting the *Unique*
option. Just to be safe, you can decide to toggle the same setting for Xcode as a whole by navigating
to *Xcode->Preferences->Locations*, then clicking on *Advanced* yet again.

Next, you are going to want to show the issue navigator. Once you have navigated over, you want to go
through each of the projects included in the workspace, performing the changes to update the projects
to the recommended Xcode settings. Make sure to leave all of the items under each drop down
containing the updates checked before selecting to perform the changes.

Lastly, before building the project, you want to ensure the `.env.json` file is at the root of the
project containing all of the correct environment variables. Reach out if you don't have this file
already, or fear it may be out of date.

Lastly, you can start up your own npm packager instance

```zsh
npm start
```

Once the packager is running, run the project in Xcode using *âŒ˜+R*, or from the terminal with the
following command

```zsh
react-native run-ios
```
